# "Smart" integer scaling mode.
# This mode uses a complicated set of heuristics to decide whether
# to underscale or overscale the content. Sometimes it overscales
# even if it would crop far more than the content's overscan area.
# However, it behaves properly for 224p content (240p with 8 pixels
# of cropping from the top and bottom) at 720p, 800p (Steam Deck),
# 1080p and 4k. If you're using a 1440p display, turn off integer
# scaling or set the integer scaling mode to Underscale.
