# Integer scaling modes:
# 0 = Underscale
# 1 = Overscale
# 2 = Smart
# 
# Smart scaling uses a complicated and buggy set of heuristics to
# decide whether to underscale or overscale the content. It's useful
# for 240p and 224p content since it'll choose the best option for
# 720p, 800p (Steam Deck), 1080p and 4k without having to switch
# between underscale and overscale modes manually.
# 
# If you're using a 1440p display, Smart mode will overscale too much,
# so change this 0 (Underscale).
